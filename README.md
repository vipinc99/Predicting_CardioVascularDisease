The project's goal is to use a variety of risk factor analyses to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Based on health markers, lifestyle decisions, and demographic information, the project aims to create predictive models that can properly identify people at risk of CVD with the use of machine learning techniques and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The project aims to improve prediction accuracy and model interpretability by means of data preparation, model training, and evaluation. This will ensure that the elements influencing predictions are transparent. The ultimate objective is to implement an intuitive web application that allows people to evaluate their risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), encouraging early detection and preventive actions to enhance the public's health outcomes associated with CVDs.
